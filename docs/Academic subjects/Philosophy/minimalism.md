# Minimalism

## Summary: 

Minimalism is essentially about owning fewer possessions. 
It's something I'm striving towards, but definitely have more work to do.

I think they key arguments are:
* Better for the environment
* Less emphasis on possessions and more on people
* Gratitude for what you already have
* Saving money that can be used for more important things
* More time because you don't waste it shopping 


## tips:

Basically just block amazon, ebay, ecommerce, clothes websites, etc. If you find yourself mindlessly 
scrolling through various websites, eventually you will get tempted to buy something. And the more time you 
spend on those websites the higher chance you will find things that you want.
