# Language learning

## Summary: 

Disclaimer - I only know one language well. And two other languages I have a small 
understanding of at around a B1 level. However I also haven't put much time in or made language learning a priority 
so I can't expect great results.

I think for something like Mandarin unless you're prepared to live in China for 2 or 3 years then 
it's probably going to be extremely difficult to reach fluency. And since relatively few people travel outside of 
china, despite that it has a high number of global speakers it's not the most practical language to learn.

But learning European languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Italian will be much easier. I think Spanish is 
probably one of the best second languages as there are so many speakers out there.
