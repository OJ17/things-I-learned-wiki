# Staying on track

Many people learn these lessons early on, but they quickly forget them,
and in some cases it might be years before they re-learn them.


So for me the plan of action is to write down a list on my desk 
that I literally have to look at and move around every day 
That reminds me of the key lessons I've learned. 

It's really critical in this process to be mindful of the lessons you've learned.
