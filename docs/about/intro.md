# About

This wiki is designed by me. I'm a software engineer who is interested in being 
a better person and giving something back to the world.

The primary goals of this wiki:

* It is not intended to be an exhaustive wiki in the ordinary sense 
but is a combination of links as a springboard for the reader to discover other things. The aim was to give the facts as much as
  I know them, and then the reader can investigate to a level of depth as their time permits.


* It is meant to be a summary and reminder of just the key lessons that I've learned that have contributed to my own psychological development.
For example rather than spending hours reading books about the benefits of exercise, just a super high level summary of the key benefits. 
  And then use the time you saved to actually exercise.


*  It is a summary of some of the more interesting things I've found online. I've spent far too long online 
personally, so I've seen a lot of stuff. I thought it would be useful to document some of the higher quality content for others. I believe a lot of the time in life what you give away comes back to you.


* A way for me to share my own personal interests, books, ideas, etc. with others more quickly. When meeting new people I often find myself
repeating the same things, or trying to find links, books recommendations, etc. so this site makes it easier to do that.

Of course, much like myself, it is a work in progress but hopefully it can help others in some way to avoid making all the mistakes I made.
