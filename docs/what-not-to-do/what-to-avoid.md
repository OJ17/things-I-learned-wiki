# What not to do

Summary:

This could literally be an endless list. However The key thing here 
is establishing what things are actually adding value to your life.

It's really fucking easy to lie to yourself about this. REALLY easy.

For me I realised that I was almost unconsciously spending upwards of 
20-30 hours a week on youtube, twitter, the news, and reddit combined.

Maybe you prefer Facebook, Instagram, UFC, Football, boxing, or something else.

The point here is to be highly mindful about how you are using your time.

Essentially you have to ask yourself:

```javascript
switch (DoesThisGetMeCloserToMyGoals){
    case "yes":
        doIt();
    case "no":
        dontDoIt();
    default:
        dontDoIt();
}
```

It's really as simple as that. But we aren't robots.


Things to avoid:

* YouTube: Don't watch YouTube except for very specific relevant things. 
On balance YouTube isn't worth it. It's just not worth it. Can be useful for tutorials, etc. though.


* Netflix: 95% Waste of time


* Steam: Just say no kids


* Video games generally: Unless you're an aspiring streamer or professional. Video games can be hugely entertaining. 
But if you want to get anywehre in life then. 


* Reddit: Avoid reddit too for the most part. The knowledge you gain there 
isn't worth the time trade-off. Can be useful for specific things nonethless.


* Social media: A total waste of time.


* news websites: Don't pay much attention to the news. Quickly check once a day or less. 
Chances are none of it matters that much. And if it does people will tell you about it.


* Sports: Ignore sports. If you can't change it, it doesn't matter!

```
If you can't change it, it doesn't matter!
If you can't change it, it doesn't matter!
If you can't change it, it doesn't matter!
If you can't change it, it doesn't matter!
```

* cryptocurrency: research, buy, hold, forget. Checking every day or multiple times a day? Waste of time.


* Stocks and shares: Not worth it unless you're putting big cash in. Pick good companies, diversify, and hold. Checking every day? Waste of time. Consider an index fund.


* Listening to music: On balance not worth it.


* Feeling sorry for yourself. - Don't do it. Total waste of time.


* Overthinking. Honestly shut your mind up and get to work.


* Dwelling on bad feelings such as loneliness, depression, etc. - Bad idea.


* holding onto a relationship too long. When you know you no longer feel the same then 
don't waste any time and get ready to go.
