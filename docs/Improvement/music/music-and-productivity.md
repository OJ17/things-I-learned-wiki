# Music and productivity:

I'm focused on deep work here (complex programming or "focus work"). Rather than something like picking items in a warehouse or tidying a room. 

So it seems this question is still not settled. I think it's quite clear that listening to music with any sort of lyrics is not good 
for attention or focus. Personally that would include even music I've listened to many times.

Intuitively it would be better to not listen to music at all, and put 100% of your attention on the complex task you're solving. However, 
if the alternative is a noisy office, or noisy neighbours, then putting on some LoFi / ambient / instrumental music will be preferable. 

So for me when it's nice and quiet, and I have some complex work then I work in silence. If there are external noises that are outside of my control I will
 instead put music on. I also think music can help with somewhat repetitive tasks.

I've been using brain.fm for a few weeks. It's been great for concentration so far:
