### Summary: 

* Positive affirmations


* Gratitude lists


* Cutting out the news 100%


* Cutting out toxic people from your life


* Surrounding yourself with positive / successful people


* Volunteering (psychological benefits)


* Massage (health benefits of touch)


* Chew often (to strengthen Jaw muscles)

* Everybody is fighting something


* Ulysses contract


* "hourly awareness chimes" / a temporary process of setting an alarm
every hour, checking that you are productive or not


* The body is designed to be upright and to be in motion. If you sit upright whilst working you will have more energy.


* Dopamine Detox (i.e. be bored for a while)


* Use an electric toothbrush. It is more effective and will pay for itself in reduced dental fees / pain


* Using a smartwatch to save time in checking for notifications


* Walking after eating - By doing this you help speed up digestion and lower your blood sugar level


* Buy pre-cooked food to save cooking time / Essentially you should try and outsource certain activities, so you can focus your attention on
higher quality ones.


* Put a time cost on every hour you spend (i.e. value your time at $50 per hour, and adjust your behaviour accordingly).


* track your time for a week to really understand where it's going. For example using [Toggl.com](https://toggl.com/) 


* See a therapist (maybe?)


* regularly use an isolation tank (sensory deprivation tank)


* Try pre-cooked meals to save time (meal delivery services), or try something like [Huel](https://uk.huel.com/).


* Buy a high quality ergonomic chair (i.e. steelcase or Herman Miller). This will easily pay for itself over time in terms of high productivity and less back ache.


* Hypnosis (apparently there is some decent science behind it)


* Laser Eye Surgery


### Small tips and tricks

I'm sure 99% of you know this stuff, but just in case you don't!

* Blow on hot food to cool it down, so you can eat faster (also works for stupidly hot coffee).


* Don't eat for 4 hours before sleeping as it can interfere with sleep
