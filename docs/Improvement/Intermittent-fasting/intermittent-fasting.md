# Intermittent fasting

### Summary:

Some people find this effective to keep high levels of concentration in the afternoon.
Usually most people report a dip in productivity after lunch which can be avoided by skipping lunch.

`16:8` is a common form of fasting, meaning to fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window. 
Then repeat that each day. Typically, this might be like: don't eat after 8pm, then only eat after 12pm the next day.
Although the hours are individual preference as long as you have a 16-hour block without eating food.

## apps:

I'm currently using this one, and it's quite helpful. There may be better ones on the market though.
