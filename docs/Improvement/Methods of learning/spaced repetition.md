# Spaced repetition

### Summary:

Spaced repetition / flashcards.

I haven't used this extensively yet, but Anki seems really popular 
with medical students. Althoguh it can be used for other cases such as 
Geography, languages, and law.

"Anki is quickly becoming an important resource for many medical students in the US. A study in 2015 at Washington University School of Medicine found that 31% of students who responded to a medical education survey reported using Anki as a study resource." - Anki Wikipedia
