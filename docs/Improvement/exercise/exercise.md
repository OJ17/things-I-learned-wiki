# Exercise

## Summary: 

Countless well documented health benefits. If exercise was a drug it would be hailed as a miracle.

Cardio seems better for mental health.

* Better sleep (and all the benefits that derive from that)
* Reduced Cancer risk
* Maintaining healthy weight
* Better aging (in terms of balance, daily strength, etc.)
* Better mental health
* Stimulates Neuroplasticity
* Increases ATP production

## Conclusion:

exercise regularly. Cardio and resistance training both have benefits.

At least exercise a few hours a week.

If you really want the best benefits you should really try and reach a point of exhaustion.
