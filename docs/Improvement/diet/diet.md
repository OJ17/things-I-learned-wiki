# Diet

## Summary:

Eat vegetables every day.

Avoid refined sugar.

Don't eat in the 4 hours before sleep if possible.

Sweeteners are potentially correlated with weight gain (conflicting evidence)

Drink water. 8 glasses a day is a myth, but drinking a good amount of water 
is a good idea. I don't know how much exactly but 2 liters is a ballpark figure.
