# The effects of pornography use

### Summary:

This is very much an understudied area right now. But it's worth being aware of.
It's also worth splitting up pornography and masturbation. 

With the general opinion that masturbation may even have some health benefits such as reducing prostate cancer risk, and 
effects on mood. Although given it releases nitric-oxide it can make you sleepy and less motivated.

I think the book `Your Brain on Porn` is worth reading, although I don't agree with all of it. It gives an interesting 
take on the harms of pornography. 

Some of the key potential harms are related to:

* Body image issues
* Lack of motivation / low energy
* Addiction and wasting time
* Altering reward pathways in the brain
* Altering sexual preferences towards extremes
* Delayed Ejaculation, Erectile dysfunction

I think this one where the jury is still out. With some claiming that pornography is totally fine
and other claiming it's going to ruin your life. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

My personal take is that it's probably best decided on a case-by-case basis. And that it could be worth experimenting with abstention
 from pornography. By doing that you will reclaim some time and learn if it works for you.
