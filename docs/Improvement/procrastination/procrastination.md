# Procrastination

### Summary:

Will fuck up your life. Until you can regulate your time you won't go anywhere.

So how to avoid it?

For me there is one fundamental principle here.

That of not giving in to your impulses. What you don't feed will die. Use this 
to your advantage.

So how do you stop feeding it? This is where you use technology to your benefit. 
To make the technology work with you and not against you. This is not about rejecting 
technology, it is about using it in a way that takes you towards, and not away from your goals.


For me I was dealing with `technology addiction` and you can read about that section there for suggestions.  about how to avoid it.

The other aspect is about understanding why you are wasting time. 

A `dopamine detox` is worth considering. But essentially this may not be about dopamine, but about 
refusing to spend time on low value activities.
