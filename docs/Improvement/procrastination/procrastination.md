# Procrastination

## Summary:

`n.b. This page is very much a work in progress as I work to develop a more in depth explanation.`


### Procrastionation is an emotion-regulation problem:

Tim Pychyl who has a PhD in procrastination research says:

`“It’s all about our feelings,” Pychyl says. “Procrastination is the misregulation of emotion. We think that by putting things off, we’re going to feel better.”

and that:

“Procrastination is an emotion-regulation problem. It’s not a time management problem. It’s about really dealing with our feelings.”

“It’s not a matter about feeling like it, no one said you have to wait until you feel like it,” 
Pychyl says. “You hear people say: ‘I don’t want to do it’, but here is the whole point . . . what does wanting have to do with it?”

### A strategy to change

`Good intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen.` - Jeff Bezos

In a sense procrastination is a somewhat personal thing. In my case I didn't enjoy the work I was doing 
had a sleep disorder, a bad mindset, and fairly problematic technology addiction.
