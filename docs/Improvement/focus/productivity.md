# Productivity

### Summary:

The key to being productive is cutting out things that don't matter.

This is the sacrifice that is necessary to attain your goals.

You have a little over 6000 thoughts per day. So if you spend them 
on listening to music and lyrics on repeat, or filling your mind with stress
or distractions you won't have time for what matters.

The journey to success begins in the mastery of your thoughts.

So you must first take control of these 6000 thoughts. It is not necessarily 
better to work 16 hours a day, compared to working 10 hours a day consistently.
Sometimes less is more. Especially if you will feel burnout from working 16 hours.
