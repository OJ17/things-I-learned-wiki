# Sleep

### Summary: 

Countless well documented health benefits. 
* Increased energy
* Increased mood
* increased concentration
* Higher testosterone levels (and Libido)
* Reduced cancer risk
* High pain resistance
* Lower stress / cortisol levels


### Lessons to apply:

These are a bit subjective because some people can sleep in loud, bright places without trouble. 
For most people a quiet, cool dark place is better. 


* Sleep in quiet place (sound can interefere with sleep).
* Sleep in a dark place. (Bluelight Glasses) Light affects sleep (melatonin known as the vampire hormone). 
* Aim to get 8 hours. Some people need slightly more.
* Avoid Eating anything big in the 4 hours before bed.
* avoid caffeine after mid-day
* Sex / Masturbation can also help due to release of nitric oxide into the bloodstream.
* Hard exercise can improve sleep quality.


## Other things to try
* Improve Sleep Hygeine (limited evidence)
* Weighted Blanket
* Magnesium supplementation
* Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia - (CBTi)


### Conclusion:

Ideally it's good to sleep for 7-8 hours a day (although this varies between individuals). 
And it's not the end of the world if you can't manage to sleep that much though, sometimes getting 
stressed or overly conscious about bad sleep makes it worse.
