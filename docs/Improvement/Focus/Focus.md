# Focus

## Summary:

Learning to focus is one of the most important skills in the modern world.

With more distraction and forms of entertainment than ever, it's easy to let years 
pass by without really making any progress.

Focus often requires self-regulation, and the ability to delay short term gratification in 
pursuit of larger long term rewards.
