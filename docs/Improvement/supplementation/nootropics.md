# Nootropics

### Summary: 

Nootropics are billed as cognitive enhancers. There are a few supplements that work
but for the most part you'd be better off spending that same energy ensuring you have all the basics down such as 
sleep, exercise, socialising, and nutrition first.



For some people Caffeine + L-theanine works well.

Green tea (Has natural source of L-theanine)

Nicotine patches, gum, or vaping (vaping is less healthy) 
(NOT TOBACCO) - For me pretty good, but reasonably high addiction potential. [Gwern - nicotine](https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine)

Modafinil - Very useful for those dealing with fatigue or exhaustion.
Used by military. Available to buy online with Ethereum. For me really positive with very few side-effects. [Gwern - Modafinil](https://www.gwern.net/Modafinil) 

CBD oil - [Need to research this more. before giving a better summary. So far seems to be quite effective for sleep / anxiety] 

Caffeine - Not great for me on balance. 

### Conclusion:

Focus on sleep, exercise, and work first.

Modafinil is a standout. I am currently doing more research but initial results are promising.

Depending on your tolerance for caffeine then drinking a cup or two of green tea on a morning can be 
really useful. Of course, it may cause sleep issues for those sensitive to it.
