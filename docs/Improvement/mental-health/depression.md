# depression

### Disclaimer: none of this is `Medical advice` I'm just sharing some of the things that helped me

### Summary: 

#### Try the basic stuff first:

* Sleep 8 hours
* Exercise 5 days a week (tiring yourself out exercise)
* Socialise often
* Maintain a good diet
* Do meditation daily
* Stop drinking alcohol
* action > thinking. So just start working. "Mood follows action".

If it is not possible to accomplish these things (such as having insomnia) 
then seek medical advice in order resolve the fundamental problems first.

If it is hard to socialise and you have no support network then therapy may also 
be an option.

Sometimes life can be really difficult. And even for years at a time. Ultimately you have to 
keep some faith that things will improve in future. Even when it seems completely impossible.

#### Second line:

Magic mushrooms / LSD has shown some evidence to treat depression

CBT / Talking therapy is worth learning

If you are lucky enough to have the funds then Therapy may help you to escape from harmful patterns of thought
(for example: Comparison with others, envy, low self-esteem, self-pity, negative views about the future, about yourself, etc.)

#### 3rd line:

SSRI's come with a lot of side effects and for many are no more 
effective than placebo. Nonetheless they do help some people.
