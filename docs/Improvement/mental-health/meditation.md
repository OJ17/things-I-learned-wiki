# meditation

### Summary: 
Increases gray matter in pre-frontal cortex. Makes you more calm, less stressed,
more able to control your own behaviour. Also it makes you more productive as it helps increase focus.

Thinking more is not necessarily better. In fact thinking less, but applying more 
will far succeed relentless thought. In my case often my thoughts are repetitive, or just not in any way constuctive.
So by being mindful of them, you can start reclaim that wasted mental energy on something positive and proactive. Rather than
 being the person who complains or feels sorry for themselves.


### Process:

If you are a beginner then using an app on android / iOS 
is a good place to start. 
And try to build up a good practice there by doing the daily meditation for 10 or 20 minutes.

Like most things in life consistency is important to really get the benefits.

I've used a few apps so far, and my personal favourite is `Waking up` because it seems to be more rooted in science and 
psychology and going a bit deeper to explain the tricks the mind plays on itself. It is a bit more expensive though.

Calm is also quite good, but I didn't feel like it had as much substance.
