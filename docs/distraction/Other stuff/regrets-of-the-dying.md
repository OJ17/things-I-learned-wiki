# Common regrets of the dying
```
"I wish I'd taken more risks"
"I wish I'd dedicated myself to make my dreams a reality"
"I wish I told others how much I love them"
"I wish I'd taken better care of my body"
"I wish I didn't hold on to grudges"
"I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends"
"I wish I'd trusted my instincts"
```
