## Watches

My advice to anyone considering collecting watches is not to waste your time. 
Having spent far longer than I want to admit researching a vast array of watches, 
movements, complications, materials, brands, general horology, marketing, etc.

I think 99% of people will be better off just buying an Apple watch or android equivalent smartwatch.

So now that I've said that watch collecting is kind of dumb, nonetheless I did learn a thing or two about watches.

So here is a short list of good brands that you can buy at a cheap price:

```
G-shock
Casio
San Martin (from Aliexpress)
Seiko
Citizen (Eco-Drive)
```

Of course there are other brands that could be on that list.

If you still insist on buying watches I wouldn't recommend to buy anything above £/$500 honestly. The truth is that 
99% of people don't care AT ALL about what watch you have on your wrist. They wont even notice. 
And the 1% that care aren't worth impressing in the first place. You may buy a nice watch for yourself but far better 
to spend it on education, investment, charity, or an amazing holiday if you have £10,000 to burn.

Watches aren't an investment. They are unreasonably expensive, unnecessary, and 
honestly just all around it's a bad hobby to get into. It's time consuming, materialistic, and at the end of it nothing changed. 
Like you could be walking round with a highly expensive watch on your wrist and your life would be exactly the same exept your 
bank account is less.

Of course, it's fun to read about them and why one watch can cost £10 and another costs £500,000. Ultimately though 
better to spend that same time and energy on something actually worthwhile.
