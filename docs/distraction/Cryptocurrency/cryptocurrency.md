# Cryptocurrency

## Summary:

Cryptographic currency. Potentially a remedy for government controlled [Fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp) currency.

Part of the reason inflation is sky high is due to government monetary policies and central banks. Due to quantitative easing 
And the constant [printing of money](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) without any corresponding assets.

## Which coins should I buy according to you?:

The general advice is to buy when you hear phrases like '1 year low', rather than buy when it's at 'all time high'.
If you start hearing 'all time high' then it's probably time to sell.


The safest coins (most likely to be around in 10 years). Lower returns but less risk.
```
Bitcoin
Ethereum
```

I think having been in the market a long time that for most people it's probably better to play it safe and keep the 
majority of your holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

More risky coins that have huge communities or ecosystems that will probably still be around:
```
Solana (SOL)
Cardano (ADA)
Ripple (XRP)
```

## Potentially also good but highly risky 
Very high risk, very high reward.
```
Lukso (LXYe)
MetisDao (METIS)
```
